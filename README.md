# Gpredict GS-232 Satellite Rotator Controller

This repository contains two complementary components for a DIY satellite tracking rotator system:

* Arduino-based firmware for controlling a pan/tilt head using the GS-232 protocol.
* A Python-based proxy server that listens for rotor commands from applications like Gpredict and forwards them to the microcontroller using the GS-232 protocol on a serial connection.

## üìÅ Directory Overview

### `gs232rotator/`

* Platform: ESP32-S3 (Arduino)
* Implements a subset of the [GS-232 rotor control protocol](file:///C:/Users/adamm/Downloads/GS232A.pdf "GS-232 rotor control protocol")
* Controls relays for azimuth and elevation motion
* I am using a BNO055 IMU sensor for compass bearing (AZ) and tilt (EL)

### `gpredictpythonrotatorproxy/`

* Lightweight Python 3 socket server
* Listens on TCP port 7777
* Emulates a subset of the `rotctld` (Hamlib) commands
* Communicates with the ESP32-S3 controller via serial to control the motors via GS-232

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Flash the firmware** in `gs232rotator/` to your ESP32-S3 using Arduino IDE.
2. **Run the Python proxy** on your computer:

   or edit the .bat file and run it from there

   ```bash
   python rotator_proxy.py --serial-port COM12 --baud 115200 --listen-host 127.0.0.1 --listen-port 7777
   ```
3. **Configure Gpredict**:
   * Name `RS232Proxy`
   * Host: `127.0.0.1`
   * Port:`7777`
   * Az Type: `0 > 180 > 360`

## üß≠ Sensor Calibration

The BNO055 sensor must be calibrated to ensure accurate azimuth (AZ) and elevation (EL) readings.

On first boot, if no calibration offsets are found in EEPROM, the system will automatically enter calibration mode and display calibration progress on the OLED screen. Once calibration is complete, offsets are saved to EEPROM.

You can manually re-run calibration anytime by sending the `CALIBRATE` command over serial.

### üõ† Calibration Procedure

1. Power on the system. If no offsets are stored, it will enter calibration mode automatically.
2. Rotate the system gently in all directions (pan and tilt) until all four systems reach `3/3/3/3`:
   - SYS (System)
   - GYR (Gyroscope)
   - ACC (Accelerometer)
   - MAG (Magnetometer)
3. When calibration is complete, you'll see `CALIBRATION DONE!` on the display.
4. The offsets are written to EEPROM and used automatically on future boots.
5. You can view the current offsets using the `CALSTATS` serial command.
6. If desired, copy the printed offsets and hard-code them by enabling `USE_HARDCODED = true` in your firmware and updating the `defaultOffsets` struct.

### üî§ Related Serial Commands

| Command     | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `CALIBRATE` | Starts the calibration routine       |
| `CALSTATS`  | Prints current calibration offsets   |

## üßæ Serial Command Reference

The ESP32 controller accepts a mix of GS-232-style and custom serial commands over USB (or virtual serial via proxy).

### üéõ GS-232 Compatible Commands

| Command     | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `AZxxx.x`   | Set target azimuth (e.g. `AZ123.4`)         |
| `ELxxx.x`   | Set target elevation (e.g. `EL45.6`)        |
| `AZ`        | Report current azimuth                     |
| `EL`        | Report current elevation                   |
| `P`         | Report current position as `AZ EL`         |
| `SA`        | Stop azimuth movement                      |
| `SE`        | Stop elevation movement                    |
| `VE`        | Report firmware version (returns `VEAdamESP32v1.0`) |
| `Q` or `q`  | Disconnect from Gpredict / rotctld         |

### üõ† Custom Utility Commands

| Command     | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `HELP`      | Show list of available commands             |
| `CALIBRATE` | Start calibration and store offsets to EEPROM |
| `CALSTATS`  | Print current calibration offsets           |

> All responses end with a `\r` (carriage return), as expected by Gpredict/rotctld.
>  
> Invalid or unknown commands will return `RPRT -1\r`.
